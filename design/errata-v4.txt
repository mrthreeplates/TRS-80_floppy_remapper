Errors (Thanks to Tuc for spotting these...)

1) The resistor values in the schematic are wrong, but correct in the BoM.  They were chosen after the schematic was created to optimize for the led brightness.
2) The capacitor values in the BoM are wrong.  Please consult the schematic for the correct values.
